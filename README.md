# Basic-Image-Classification-with-Tensorflow

This is a mini-project I completed under Coursera Project Network. 

In the project, I have built a Neural Network model that classifies images and predicts the hand-written digits with an accuracy of <b>96%<b>. 
  
<b>Dataset Used - <b> MNIST dataset of handwritten digits. 
<b>Data preprocessing<b> - Unrolled the columns and applied Data Normalisation <i>(x-m)/s<i>.
