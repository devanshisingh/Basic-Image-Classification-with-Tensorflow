# Basic-Image-Classification-with-Tensorflow

This is a mini-project I completed under Coursera Project Network. 

In the project, I have built a Neural Network model that classifies images and predicts the hand-written digits with an accuracy of <b>96%</b>. 

<ul>
  <li><b>Dataset Used</b> - MNIST dataset of handwritten digits.</li>
  <li><b>Data preprocessing</b> - Unrolled the array to vector and applied Data Normalisation <i>(x-m)/s</i>.</li>
  <li><b>Creating model</b> - Used ReLU activation function for the input and the hidden layers and Softmax activation function for the output layer.</li>
